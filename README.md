# Project-1---Clean-Train-Housing-Dataset
For Project 1, I delved deeper into the Ames Housing Dataset. I completed a more in depth data cleaning/wrangling process, which I attempted to clean all the missing values to the best of my ability. Once the data was clean I attempted to create a learning model to predict the Sale Price of the houses.
